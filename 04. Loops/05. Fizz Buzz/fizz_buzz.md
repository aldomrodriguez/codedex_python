# 21\. Fizz Buzz

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/21-fizz-buzz#congrats) Congrats!

You've made it to the end of this chapter! Let's do a recap. 🥳

The `while` loop iterates over and over again while the condition is true:

    while coffee < 1:
      print('tired')
    

The `for` loop and the `range()` function to iterate for a certain number of times:

    for i in range(10):
      print(i)
    

Now let's take your learnings to the test!

[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies. 🐝

Though this challenge may appear simple to experienced coders, it is designed to weed out 90% of job candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively. Want to give it a try?

Create a **fizz\_buzz.py** program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

Here's the catch:

-   For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
-   For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
-   Here's the tricky part: For multiples of 3 _and_ 5, print "FizzBuzz".

The output should look like:

    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    ...
    

Btw, it's totally okay if you can't get this one... it's a tough problem! Take a look at the hint and the solution before moving forward to the Checkpoint Project! ⛳️
