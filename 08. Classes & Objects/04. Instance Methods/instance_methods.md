Now that we can create classes and objects, and edit their properties, our last step is to create functions.

Wait... functions in classes?! Isn't that super complicated?

Actually, it's not. Functions that are defined in a class are called **methods**. In fact, we have already used a bunch of methods. For example, in [exercise 25](https://www.codedex.io/python/25-reading-list), we looked at a few built-in list methods, such as:

-   `.insert()`
-   `.append()`
-   `.remove()`

These are built-in methods. Let's create our own methods within a class!

Consider our `Student` class:

    class Student: 
      def __init__(self, name, year, enrolled, gpa):
        self.name = name
        self.year = year
        self.enrolled = enrolled
        self.gpa = gpa
    

To implement a method, we need to define one inside the class. For example, if we want to create a method called `.display_info()`, we would define it like so:

    class Student: 
      def __init__(self, name, year, enrolled, gpa):
        self.name = name
        self.year = year
        self.enrolled = enrolled
        self.gpa = gpa
      
      def display_info(self):
        print('The student ' + self.name + '\'s GPA is ' + str(self.gpa) + '!')
    

But remember, like a function, defining a method doesn't automatically run the code inside the method's body. We still need to call the method as follows:

    mitsuha = Student('ÂÆÆÊ∞¥‰∏âËëâ', 11, False, 4.0)
    taki = Student('Á´ãËä±ÁÄß', 11, True, 3.8)
    
    mitsuha.display_info()
    taki.display_info()
    
    # Output:
    # The student ÂÆÆÊ∞¥‰∏âËëâ's GPA is 4.0!
    # The student Á´ãËä±ÁÄß's GPA is 3.8!
    

**Note:** Take a look at `def display_info(self)`. Like what we learned about with the `__init__()` method, the first argument in the methods we make is always `self`. Every method has to have this `self` argument. The object attached to the method call is what `self` refers to.

In our example, we created two objects, `mitsuha` and `taki`.

-   When we called the `mitsuha.display_info()` method, the `self` parameter refers to the `mitsuha` object.
-   In the case of `taki.display_info()`, `self` refers to the `taki` object.

Also, you can define as many methods as you'd like!

    class Student: 
      def __init__(self, name, year, enrolled, gpa):
        self.name = name
        self.year = year
        self.enrolled = enrolled
        self.gpa = gpa
      
      def display_info(self):
        print('The student ' + self.name + '\'s is ' + str(self.gpa) + '!')
      
      def graduation(self):
        if self.enrolled and self.gpa > 2.5 and self.year == 12:
          print(self.name + ' will be able to graduate this year!')

It's time to open up a bank account! üè¶

Create a file called **bank\_accounts.py**.

Let's define a `BankAccount` class. Then, let's use the `__init__()` method to set the following attributes:

-   `first_name` (string)
-   `last_name` (string)
-   `account_id` (integer)
-   `account_type` (string)
-   `pin` (integer)
-   `balance` (float)

Next, let's create three methods:

-   `.deposit()`: Add money into the account and return the new `balance`.
-   `.withdraw()`: Take money out by subtracting from `balance` and returning the withdrawn amount.
-   `.display_balance()`: Print the current value of `balance`.

Lastly, initialize a new object from the `BankAccount` class and use these methods to do the following:

-   Deposit $96 in the account.
-   Withdraw $25 from the account.
-   Print the current account balance.
