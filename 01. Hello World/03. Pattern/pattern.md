## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/03-pattern#line-by-line) Line by Line

Python is run one line at a time, from top to bottom.

We can output multiple messages by using multiple `print()` functions. For example, if we want to print out two simple greetings:

    print('🌻 Morning Dharma!')
    print('🙋🏽 Evening Sonny!')
    

This will output:

    🌻 Morning Dharma!
    🙋🏽 Evening Sonny!
    

Now let's use what we just learned to complete a special challenge! ⋆˙⟡

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/03-pattern#instructions) Instructions

Suppose we want the output to look exactly like this pattern below:

           1
         2 3
       4 5 6
    7 8 9 10
    

How can you do that?

Create a **pattern.py** program that prints this pattern exactly as shown.

This will likely take some trial and error, but give it a shot!
