In some online multiplayer games, there's a KDA ratio to evaluate a player's in-game performance:

KDA\=(k+a)/dKDA = (k + a) / dKDA\=(k+a)/d

-   kkk is how many players you took down.
-   ddd is how many times you died.
-   aaa is how many assists you had.

Write a `kda()` function that takes in parameters: `k`, `d`, `a`.

This function should calculate and return the KDA ratio that uses these paremeters.
