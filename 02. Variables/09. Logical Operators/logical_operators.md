# 15\. The Cyclone

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/15-the-cyclone#logical-operators) Logical Operators

One more thing that we should learn is logical operators.

**Logical operators**, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. They are `and`, `or`, and `not` operators:

-   `and` returns `True` if both conditions are `True`, and returns `False` otherwise.
-   `or` returns `True` if at least one of the conditions is `True`, and `False` otherwise.
-   `not` returns `True` if the condition is `False`, and vice versa.

Here are some examples:

    if hunger > 4 and anger > 1:
      print('Hangry')
    

If the `hunger` variable is greater than 4 _and_ the `anger` variable is greater than 1, then the program prints "Hangry".

    if coffee > 0 or bubble_tea > 0:
      print('ðŸ˜Š')
    

If the `coffee` variable is greater than 0 _or_ the `bubble_tea` variable is greater than 0, then the program prints a smiley face.

    if not tired:
      print('Time to code!')
    

If the `tired` variable is _not_ `True`, then the program prints "Time to code!"

So you might be wondering: `and` and `or` are awfully similar, how do I remember the differences between the two? Let's break this down in a table form:

```
| A     | B     | A and B | A or B |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| False | False | False   | False  |
| False | True  | False   | True   |
| True  | False | False   | True   |
| True  | True  | True    | True   |
```

Since 1927, ["The Cyclone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island_Cyclone) roller coaster has delighted visitors at Coney Island (Brooklyn, NY). ðŸŽ¢

They're now installing a new entry system (the height requirement is 137 cm and the cost is 10 credits) and need your help writing the program for it!

Create a new file called **the\_cyclone.py**.

Ask the user what their height is and how many credits they have, and store the values in a `height` variable and a `credits` variable.

Use a combination of relational and logical operators to create the rules:

-   If they are tall enough and have enough credits, print "Enjoy the ride!"
-   Else if they have enough credits, but they aren't tall enough, print "You are not tall enough to ride."
-   Else if they are tall enough, but they don't have enough credits, print "You don't have enough credits."
-   Else, print a message saying they have not met either requirement.
