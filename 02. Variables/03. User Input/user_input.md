# 09\. Pythagorean Theorem

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/09-pythagorean#user-input) User Input

Thus far, we've only been outputting things to the user, making our programs one-sided and not that fun. Almost every popular website, mobile app, or video game nowadays have both input and output.

So how do we get input from the user?

Python uses the `input()` function to get user input:

    username = input('Enter your name: ')
    
    print(username)
    

The output will say "Enter your name: " and the user can type in something, hit enter, and whatever the user typed gets stored into the `username` variable.

So here, suppose the user typed in their name and pressed enter, it will output their name.

The whole process looks like this in the terminal:

So after the code runs, click into the Terminal, type a word, and press enter.

By default, the user input is stored as a text string, which is okay for now.

But what about when we want to get a number from a user?

In that case, we would need to wrap an `int()` around the `input()` to convert the text string into a number:

    age = int(input('What is your age? '))
    
    print(age)
    

Now that the user types 24 and presses enter, the `age` variable will be an integer 24, not a text string "24".

If you slept through your geometry class, a [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) is the relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. It was named after the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, born around 570 BC.

Pythagorean equation looks like:

  

c\=a2+b2c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}c\=a2+b2â€‹

  

-   The aaa is the length of a short side.
-   The bbb is the length of another short side.
-   The ccc is the length of the hypotenuse.

The hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle.

Create a **hypotenuse.py** program that asks the user for two numbers, `a` and `b`, and then calculates the hypotenuse `c`.
