 Edge cases are too frustrating to solve. Difficulty is inaccurate. What should be the difficulty according to you? My solution is correct but the tests are still failing. Description and/or examples are incorrect or unclear Other

[James Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_(literary_character)) is a classic movie character that fights bad guys and introduces himself in an iconic way: _‚ÄúBond, James Bond.‚Äù_

Write a `greetings()` function that takes in two parameters:

-   `first_name`
-   `last_name`

Print out the phrase with the last name, followed by a comma, and then the full name.

Next, call the function using your own name, like:

    greetings('Richard', 'Hendricks')
    

The output should look like:

    Hendricks, Richard Hendricks
    

**Note:** This function doesn't have a `return` statement.
