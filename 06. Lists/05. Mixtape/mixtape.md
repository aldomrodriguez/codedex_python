# 26\. Mixtape

Now you might be wondering, is there a way to iterate over a list? üîÅ

Yep, there are multiple ways to iterate over a list in Python! In this exercise, we are going to show you different ways to do so.

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/26-mixtape#for-in) for-in

The first way is using a `for`\-`in` loop. Here's an example:

    snowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]
    
    for i in snowfall:
      print(i)
    

The `i` is a variable which represents an item inside the list, each time the loop iterates. This is saying for every item `in` the `snowfall` list, print out the item. The output will be:

    0.3
    0.0
    0.0
    1.2
    3.9
    2.2
    0.8
    

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/26-mixtape#for-in-with-range-and-len) for-in with range() and len()

We can also loop through a list using the index (position). To do so, we need the `range()` function and the `len()` function.

As a reminder:

-   [`range()`](https://www.codedex.io/python/19-detention) function returns a sequence of numbers, from 0 to a number.
-   [`len()`](https://www.codedex.io/python/24-inventory) function returns the length of the list.

    snowfall = [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 2.2, 0.8]
    
    for i in range(len(snowfall)):
      print(snowfall[i])
    

The `i` here is an index. This is saying for every index from 0 to the length of `snowfall` minus 1 (7 - 1 = 6), print out the item at that index.

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/26-mixtape#instructions) Instructions

Back in the good ol' days, a [mixtape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mixtape) is a compilation of music, a playlist, recorded onto a cassette tape or a CD.

Create a **mixtape.py** program and think of a theme for the songs.

Make a list called `playlist` and throw in some songs.

For example:

    # üíø Theme: Indie Travel Songs
    
    playlist = [
      'Porches - rangerover',
      'Mount Eerie - You Swan, Go On',
      'Carolyn Polachek - Look at Me Now',
      'Pinegrove - Darkness',
      'LVL UP - Spirit Was',
      'Mitski - First Love / Late Spring'
    ]
    

Now loop over the list and print everything out! üìª
