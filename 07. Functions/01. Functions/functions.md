As our code gets longer and longer, you might find yourself copying and pasting a particular code block in different parts of the program. That's no good!

[‚ÄúDon't Repeat Yourself‚Äù (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is a principle in software development aimed at reducing repetition and writing good clean code. Functions play a big part.

A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. To execute this block of code, you just need to know the function's name, followed by a pair of parenthesis `(` `)`.

Whether the task is five or twenty lines of code, you can throw it in a function and use it later anywhere in your program. It takes a little more effort initially but will save you a lot of time in the long term.

Plot twist! In this course, we have been using functions all along. üß©

Built-in functions are 68 functions that come with the Python interpreter available for use. Here are some that you might recognize:

-   `print()`
-   `input()`
-   `len()`

We've used them before, but didn't get into how they work behind the scenes.

And that's okay! This is the beautiful part about built-in functions. Like a car, you don't need to know what's underneath the hood to operate it.

Let's look at some built-in Python functions!

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/28-dry#instructions) Instructions

Create a **dry.py** program and check out the [complete list of built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html):

-   Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
-   Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.

Use each of these once in the program.

For the new function, try to read the documentation (üòµ‚Äçüí´) or Google it (üëç)!

Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.
