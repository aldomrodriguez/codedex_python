# 02\. Hello World

In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to "talk." This is something we are going to use _a lot_.

The message we want to display should be inside the parentheses and surrounded by quotes. They can be double quotes `"` or single quotes `'`, but the opening and closing quote marks have to be the same.

This is an example of a `print()` function:

    print('ðŸ‘‹ Howdy')
    

In the example above, we instructed our program to print a message. This resulting text that is printed to the screen is referred to as the **output**.

The output of this example program would be:

    ðŸ‘‹ Howdy
    

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/02-hello-world#instructions) Instructions

Create a new **hello\_world.py** program.

On a new line, use `print()` to output the message "Hello World!"

And then run the program.

Were you able to print "Hello World!" in the terminal?
