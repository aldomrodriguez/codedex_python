# 18\. Guess Number

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/18-guess-number#while-loop) While Loop

Now that we got a sneak peek of a `while` loop, let's see what it does! ðŸ”„

A `while` loop looks very similar to an `if` statement. Just like an `if` statement, it executes the code if the condition is `True`.

However, the difference is that the `while` loop will continue to execute the code inside of it, over and over again, as long as the condition is `True`.

    while condition:
      # code inside
    

In other words, instead of executing once _if_ a condition is true, it executes again and again _while_ that condition is true.

Here, we have a `while` loop that asks the user to guess a number:

    guess = 0
    
    while guess != 6:
      guess = int(input('Guess the number: '))
    

This will run over and over again until the user guesses the number 6:

    Guess the number: 5
    Guess the number: 3
    Guess the number: 6
    

The variable `guess` starts at 0 on the first line and then the program enters the `while` loop:

1.  It checks the condition: is it true that 0 doesn't equal 6? Yep. Okay, run the code inside.
2.  It checks the condition again: is it true that 5 doesn't equal 6? Yep. Okay, run the code inside.
3.  It checks the condition again: is it true that 3 doesn't equal 6? Yep. Okay, run the code inside.
4.  It checks the condition again: is it true that 6 doesn't equal 6? Nope! So it exits the `while` loop and skips the code inside.

To reiterate (no pun intended), at the beginning of each "loop", the condition is checked. The moment the condition becomes false, the program exits the `while` loop and continues on from the line after it.

**Note:** If the condition is `False` from the get-go, then the code block wouldn't run at all and will be skipped.

Let's continue on from the code above.

Create a **guess.py** program and type in the following:

    guess = 0
    
    while guess != 6:
      guess = int(input("Guess the number:  "))
    
    print("You got it!")
    

Run the code a few times so that you understand what it does.

Let's make it so that it's the same guessing game, but there is a new limit to the number of tries (it was infinite before).

First, introduce a variable called `tries` at the top and give it a value of 0.

Then, add the `tries` variable to the `while` loop using a [relational operator](https://www.codedex.io/python/13-ph-levels#relational-operators) (like you did with `guess`).
