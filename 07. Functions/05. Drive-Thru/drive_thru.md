# 33\. Drive-Thru

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/33-drive-thru#congrats) Congrats!

Congratulations! You now know how functions work. This is a concept that trips up a lot of people, so definitely practice and practice. 💪

In this chapter, we learned:

-   The "Don't Repeat Yourself" methodology.
-   We've been using built-in functions like `print()` and `input()` all along.
-   How to define and call a function — the two-step process.
-   Inputs with parameters and arguments.
-   Output with the `return` keyword.
-   Function scope vs. global scope.

Here's the function skeleton one more time, just in case you forget!

    def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
      # The code inside
      return value
    

Now that you know how functions work, let's create one last one!

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/33-drive-thru#instructions) Instructions

When you go to a [drive-thru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through) like McDonald's, you can order food using the item numbers. For example, a Happy Meal might be a #3!

Create a **drive\_thru.py** program with your favorite fast food chain's menu.

Define a `get_item()` function that takes in one parameter, the number of the item you want to order, and returns the name of that item!

For example, if you called the function with:

-   Argument value `1`, it could return `'🍔 Cheeseburger'`.
-   Argument value `2`, it could return `'🍟 Fries'`.
-   Argument value `3`, it could return `'🥤 Soda'`.
-   Argument value `4`, it could return `'🍦 Ice Cream'`.
-   Argument value `5`, it could return `'🍪 Cookie'`.

Make sure to call this function a few times to make sure that it works!

Lastly, let's do the following:

-   Create a welcome menu and put that in a `welcome()` function.
-   Create a main program that takes in user input with `input()`.
