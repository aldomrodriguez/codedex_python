Now that we know how to create a class, we can create objects from this class.

An **object** is an "instance" of a class. A class is simply a template to create objects, which are individual copies of the class with actual values.

In the last exercise, we created a class to model students:

    class Student:
      student_id = 0
      name = ''
      year = 0
      gpa = 0.0
      enrolled = False
    

Using the `Student` class, let's create an object to model the infamous student, [Ferris Bueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller%27s_Day_Off). The syntax for creating an object looks like this:

    ferris = Student()
    

Now that we have created an object of `Student` and saved it to `ferris`, we can access and edit the class attributes by using the dot syntax, `.attribute`:

    ferris.student_id = 10837
    ferris.name = 'Ferris Bueller'
    ferris.year = 12
    ferris.gpa = 3.81
    ferris.enrolled = True
    

Ferris Bueller is a 12th year student with a GPA of 3.81 and is currently enrolled. So we now know how to get him out of a class! ðŸ’¨

You can check all the attributes available on the `ferris` object with the built-in `vars()` function, as follows:

    print(vars(ferris))
    
    # Output: {'student_id': 10837, 'name': 'Ferris Bueller', 'year': 12, 'gpa': 3.81, 'enrolled': True}
    

We don't have to stop there; we can create as many students as we want using just one `Student` class.

In the last exercise, we created a `Restaurant` class.

In a new file called **bobs\_burgers.py**, create an instance of the `Restaurant` class called `bobs_burgers` with the following attributes:

-   `'Bob\'s Burgers'`
-   `'American Diner'`
-   `4.7`
-   `False`

Once you do that, create two more instances of the `Restaurant` class with your favorite dinner spots nearby.

Then, use `print(vars())` to output each of the three restaurants!
