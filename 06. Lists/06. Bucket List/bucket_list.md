# 27\. Bucket List

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/27-bucket-list#congrats) Congrats!

You just added a super helpful tool to your coding toolbox: lists!

Here's a recap of the chapter:

-   Lists are used to store different items in a single variable.
-   An index is an item's position in a list. Python lists are 0-indexed.
-   Slicing can access certain parts of a list with `name[start:end]`.
-   Python has built-in functions like `len()`, `max()`, `min()`.
-   Lists have built-in methods like `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`.
-   We can iterate over a list using `for`\-`in`.

Now let's pull everything together one last time and build your bucket list!

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/27-bucket-list#instructions) Instructions

A [bucket list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_the_bucket) is a number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime. 🪣

Create a **bucket\_list.py** program with your own unique bucket list.

First, create a `things_to_do` list, and add things you want to do in your lifetime.

For example:

    things_to_do = [
      '🚀 Create the dopest learn to code platform ever.',
      '⛰️ Hike the Pacific Crest Trail.',
      '🏡 Build an A-frame house and raise some goats.',
      '🌏 Live somewhere in Asia for a year.',
      '🎸 Release an album.',
      '📝 Write a book.',
      '🏆 Reach 100k subscribers on YouTube.',
      '🚐 Road trip with the fam.',
      '🍳 Open a cozy diner upstate.',
      '👴🏻 Grow old with no regrets.'
    ]
    

Now, iterate over the list and print everything out.

Lastly, to keep yourself accountable, take a screenshot of your program and post your bucket list to Twitter by clicking the icon below.

The days are long but the years are short; from the whole Codédex team, we hope you accomplish all of your wildest dreams!
