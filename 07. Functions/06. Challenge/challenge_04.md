Why are there so many Moon emojis? Each one represents a different [Moon phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase), the shape of the Moon's sunlit portion as viewed from the Earth.

Write a `moon_phase()` function that takes in a `phase` parameter of the Moon phase name given below and returns the correct Moon emoji for it:

-   New Moon â†’ ðŸŒ‘
-   Waxing Crescent â†’ ðŸŒ’
-   First Quarter â†’ ðŸŒ“
-   Waxing Gibbous â†’ ðŸŒ”
-   Full Moon â†’ ðŸŒ•
-   Waning Gibbous â†’ ðŸŒ–
-   Last Quarter â†’ ðŸŒ—
-   Waning Crescent â†’ ðŸŒ˜

If an invalid phase name is passed to `moon_phase()`, return `'Invalid moon phase'`.

Call the `moon_phase()` and try it out:

    answer = moon_phase('New Moon')
    print(answer)      
    
    # Output: ðŸŒ‘
