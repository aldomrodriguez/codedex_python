Finding an average can be a useful way to understand the underlying trends of some data.

Write an `average()` function that takes in two parameters:

-   `num1`
-   `num2`

It should calculate and return the average of the two numbers.

The average of num1num1num1 and num2num2num2 is:

(num1+num2)/2(num1 + num2) / 2(num1+num2)/2

**Note:** Do not use the `math` module.
