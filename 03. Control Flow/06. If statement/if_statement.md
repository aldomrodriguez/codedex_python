# 12\. Grades

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/12-grades#if-statement) If Statement

An `if` statement is used to test a condition for truth:

-   If the condition evaluates to `True`, code in the `if` part is executed.
-   If the condition evaluates to `False`, code is skipped.

    if condition:
      # code inside
    

For example, if the `grade` variable is greater than 60:

    if grade > 60:
      print("You passed!")
    

The code "inside" the `if` statement must be indented (preferably 2 spaces).

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/12-grades#else) Else

An `else` clause can be optionally added to an `if` statement.

-   If the condition evaluates to `True`, code in the `if` part is executed.
-   If the condition evaluates to `False`, code in the `else` part is executed.

    if grade > 60:
      print("You passed.")
    else:
      print("You failed.")
    

The code "inside" the `else` clause must also be indented.

Holy moly, because the class's average was super low on the test, the teacher just added a curve for the test grades! ðŸ˜­

Create a **grades.py** program that checks whether a grade is above or below 55.

Start by creating a variable called `grade` and give it a value between 0-100.

Write a `if`/`else` statement for the following:

-   If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed."
-   Else, print "You failed."

After you run the code, change `grade`'s value and rerun it. Do this a few times to make sure it's working as intended.
