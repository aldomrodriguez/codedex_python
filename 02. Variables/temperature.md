Computers are incredible at doing math calculations. Now that we have learned about variables, let's use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things! üî¢

Python has the following arithmetic operators:

-   `+` Addition
-   `-` Subtraction
-   `*` Multiplication
-   `/` Division
-   `%` Modulo (returns the remainder)

    score = 0           # score is 0
    score = 4 + 3       # score is now 7
    score = 4 - 3       # score is now 1
    score = 4 * 3       # score is now 12
    score = 4 / 3       # score is now 1.3333
    score = 4 % 3       # score is now 1
    
    print(score)        # Output: 1
    

And take a look at this code that calculates a 20% tip by calculating the total and then multiplying by a float (decimal number):

    pizza = 2.99
    coke = 0.99
    
    total = pizza + coke
    
    tip = total * 0.2
    
    print(tip) # Output: 0.796
    

Another way to write this is using parentheses to calculate the total and the tip in one line of code:

    tip = (pizza + coke) * 0.2
    

In Python, parentheses have the highest order of operations.

Now that we've learned about the basics of variables and operators, let's put them to use!

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/07-temperature#instructions) Instructions

Create a **temperature.py** program that converts a number from Fahrenheit (¬∞F) to Celsius (¬∞C).

Google the current temperature of [Brooklyn, NY](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=brooklyn%20temperature) (where Cod√©dex is based) in ¬∞F.

Use the following formula and write it out in Python:

  

Celsius\=(Fahrenheit‚àí32)1.8Celsius = {(Fahrenheit - 32) \\over 1.8}Celsius\=1.8(Fahrenheit‚àí32)‚Äã

  

Print out the converted temperature. üå°Ô∏è
