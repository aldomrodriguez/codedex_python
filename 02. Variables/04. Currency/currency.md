# 10\. Currency

## [#](https://www.codedex.io/python/10-currency#congrats) Congrats!

Woohoo! You learned variables in Python! ðŸ™Œ

Here's a recap of everything we learned in this chapter:

-   Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`.
-   Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
-   The `%` modulo finds the remainder.
-   The `**` exponentiation finds the exponent.
-   The `input()` function is used to get user input.
-   The `int()` function converts a value into an integer number.

Let's put it all together now!

We just got home from a trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

-   ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Colombian pesos
-   ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª Peruvian soles
-   ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazilian reais

Create a **currency.py** program that asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates _the total_ in USD.

Make sure to Google the current exchange rates!

The output of the program should look like this:

    What do you have left in pesos? 5600
    What do you have left in soles? 105
    What do you have left in reais? 280
    413.0
    

The sequence should be:

Cha-ching! Now you have the total in USD. ðŸ’°
